DESCRIPTION:

This Java program is coded to automatically detect a language from whatever your query file contains. This program has a databases of languages which it uses to scan and detect what language it is reading from. First it reads from
the query file and then it scans the language database it has to see how many times a certain charater or series of charaters appears. Once it has a match it takes the name of the language from the end of it (denoted by @) and 
prints it.
